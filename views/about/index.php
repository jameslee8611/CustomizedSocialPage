            <p>In this project, we've mostly developed with our skills. However, the number of developers are limited and product deadline is also not plenty enough to apply all fascinating modern technologies. Therefore, we've decided to use some external sources; open source(s) and/or commercial source(s). The followings are the list of external sources we apply.</p>

            <p><strong>Image Cropper</strong>: <a href="http://www.jqueryrain.com/?BEAlLLl9">http://www.jqueryrain.com/?BEAlLLl9</a></p>

            <p>This source is free to use. But the core of this source includes MIT GNU policy. We explicitly declare about this.</p>
            <p><strong>MixeditUp</strong></p>

            <p>This source is commercial/non-commercial open source. Since our product is not commercial now, we are considered non-commercial developers. However, if it is running on the actual server and service to customers, we will buy its license.</p>
            <p>Of course this project is individual, all the copy rights are on our developers.</p>
